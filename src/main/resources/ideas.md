4. Umbra & Lux
   "The brightest light casts the darkest shadow."
   A rapier or shortsword built on a "stance" system that changes its properties based on the environment, rewarding players who are aware of their surroundings and can adapt on the fly.
   Core Mechanic: Stance Shift
   Activation: Shift + Right-Click to switch between Lux Stance and Umbra Stance. The blade's particle effects change to reflect the current stance.
   Lux Stance (Stance of Light)
   Passive: While you are standing in a light level above 8, your attacks have a chance to apply a "Sear" effect, a minor damage-over-time debuff.
   Active Ability: Flashpoint
   Activation: Right-Click.
   Cooldown: 10 seconds.
   Effect: Teleport to a targeted location within 10 blocks that is also in a high light level. Upon arrival, you emit a flash that briefly blinds nearby enemies.
   Umbra Stance (Stance of Shadow)
   Passive: While you are standing in a light level below 8, you are granted the Invisibility effect. Attacking or using an ability briefly reveals you.
   Active Ability: Shadowslip
   Activation: Right-Click.
   Cooldown: 8 seconds.
   Effect: Dash forward 6 blocks, passing through entities and dealing minor damage to them. You must be in shadow to activate this ability.
   Enchantments
   Duality (I-II): Switching stances now has an immediate effect. Switching to Lux grants a brief burst of speed. Switching to Umbra grants a brief moment of damage resistance.
   Solar Flare (I): (Lux Only) Flashpoint's blind effect is longer and also reveals any invisible players in its radius.
   Penumbra (I): (Umbra Only) Attacking no longer breaks your invisibility in Umbra Stance, but instead makes you flicker visibly for 1 second.

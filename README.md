# Fathom

> The world is older than you know.
>
> Beneath the waves, beneath the bedrock, lie secrets the world has forgotten.
>
> Echoes of power, sealed within artifacts of myth. They have laid dormant for eons.
>
> Waiting... for a will strong enough to claim them.
>
> __This power is not given. It must be earned.__

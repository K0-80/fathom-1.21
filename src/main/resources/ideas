        *   **Alacrity III:** Reduces charge time by 45% (to ~0.83s).
    *   **Why it's better:** "Alacrity" is a more magical-sounding word for speed and fits the ethereal theme. The tiered levels provide a clear sense of progression.

    *   **New Enchantment:** **Gaze (I-II)**
    *   **What it does:** The charge will not break if your crosshair strays slightly from the target. It increases the "stickiness" of the lock-on.
        *   **Zephyr's Gaze I:** You can aim up to 10 degrees away from the target's hitbox without breaking the charge.
        *   **Zephyr's Gaze II:** You can aim up to 15 degrees away.
    *   **Why it's better:** It has a clear, defined mechanic instead of being "forgiving." The name connects to the wind theme (a Zephyr is a gentle breeze) and the idea of "gazing" at a target.

        *   **Gale Force II:** Knocks back enemies within a 3-block radius.
        *   **Gale Force III:** Knocks back enemies within a 4-block radius.
    *   **Why it's better:** This is a much more dynamic and visual effect that fits the "air magic" theme perfectly. It provides crowd control, which is incredibly useful after teleporting into a group of mobs. It achieves the goal of making your arrival more impactful.
